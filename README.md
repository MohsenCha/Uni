# Abstract
Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) have become a crucial component in embedded systems, especially in microcontroller-based applications where real-time response is critical. In such systems, the RTOS provides an interface between the hardware and software components, managing system resources, scheduling tasks, and handling interrupts. ARM microcontrollers are widely used in various applications, including automotive, consumer electronics, and industrial control. This project aims to design and implement an RTOS on ARM microcontrollers to improve system performance and reliability.

# Objectives
The project will focus on the design and implementation of a real-time operating system on an ARM microcontroller, taking into consideration the hardware and software requirements. The RTOS will be responsible for scheduling and executing tasks based on their priority, handling interrupts, and managing system resources such as memory, input/output (I/O) ports, and timers. The project will also involve developing device drivers and integrating them with the RTOS.
The project will be divided into several phases, starting with the analysis of the requirements and selection of suitable hardware and software components. The RTOS will then be designed, and its functionalities will be implemented and tested on the selected hardware platform.

In conclusion, the design and implementation of an RTOS on ARM microcontrollers is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of both hardware and software. This project aims to provide a practical approach to designing and implementing an RTOS on ARM microcontrollers and evaluating its performance. The project's outcome will be a useful reference for future research and development in the field of embedded systems.
